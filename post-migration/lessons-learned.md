## Key Takeaways

1. **Pre-Migration Validation is Critical**  
   Running detailed environment checks and dry-run replication prevents post-cutover surprises.

2. **Monitoring & Observability Save Downtime**  
   Real-time metrics and alarms ensure immediate detection of anomalies, supporting rapid remediation.

3. **Rollback Planning Reduces Risk**  
   Having a pre-tested rollback plan increases confidence in executing a production cutover.

4. **Documentation is as Important as Execution**  
   Clear README, architecture, migration plan, and scripts make the project portfolio **credible to recruiters**.

5. **Production Mindset Matters**  
   Decisions on security, network isolation, and controlled access demonstrate enterprise-level thinking.
